# Process Builder Enhanced - Integration & Verification Checklist

## ‚úÖ Quick Integration Guide

### Step 1: Verify Backend Files
```
‚úì Backend/routers/process_builder_enhanced.py (CREATED)
‚úì Backend/main.py (UPDATED - added import and router registration)
```

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check if file exists
ls -la Backend/routers/process_builder_enhanced.py

# Check if imported in main.py
grep "process_builder_enhanced" Backend/main.py
```

### Step 2: Verify Frontend Files
```
‚úì Frontend/src/components/ProcessBuilderEnhanced.jsx (CREATED)
‚úì Frontend/src/styles/ProcessBuilderEnhanced.css (CREATED)
```

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check if files exist
ls -la Frontend/src/components/ProcessBuilderEnhanced.jsx
ls -la Frontend/src/styles/ProcessBuilderEnhanced.css
```

### Step 3: Add Route to Frontend
**File**: `Frontend/src/App.jsx`

```jsx
// Add import at top
import ProcessBuilderEnhanced from './components/ProcessBuilderEnhanced';

// Add route in your routes section
<Route path="/process-builder" element={<ProcessBuilderEnhanced />} />
```

### Step 4: Add Navigation Link
**File**: `Frontend/src/components/Navigation.jsx` (or similar)

```jsx
import { Zap } from 'lucide-react';

// Add link somewhere in navigation
<NavLink to="/process-builder" className="nav-link">
  <Zap size={20} />
  <span>Process Builder</span>
</NavLink>
```

### Step 5: Start Application

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd Backend
python main.py
# Backend should start on http://localhost:8000

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd Frontend
npm start
# Frontend should start on http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 6: Verify Access
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/process-builder`
- Should see Process List view
- Should be able to create, view, edit processes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

#### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'routers.process_builder_enhanced'"
- **Solution**: Ensure file is in `Backend/routers/` directory
- **Verification**: `ls Backend/routers/process_builder_enhanced.py`

#### "AttributeError: module 'routers' has no attribute 'process_builder_enhanced'"
- **Solution**: Ensure import is correct in main.py
- **Fix**: `from routers import process_builder_enhanced`

#### "Table 'process_definitions' does not exist"
- **Solution**: Tables auto-create on first API call
- **Workaround**: Call `POST /api/process/create` to trigger creation

### Frontend Issues

#### "Cannot find module './ProcessBuilderEnhanced.css'"
- **Solution**: Ensure CSS file path is correct
- **Fix**: Import should be `'../styles/ProcessBuilderEnhanced.css'`

#### "Lucide icon 'Globe' not found"
- **Solution**: Ensure all icons imported from lucide-react
- **Fix**: Added Globe to imports

#### Canvas not rendering
- **Solution**: Check browser console for errors
- **Debugging**: Verify SVG element is mounted

### Database Issues

#### Connection refused
- **Solution**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- **Start**: `docker-compose up -d postgres` or `service postgresql start`

#### Company_id NULL error
- **Solution**: Ensure user has company_id in JWT token
- **Check**: JWT token structure in auth middleware
