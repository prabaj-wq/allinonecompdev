# üîß Company Selector - Fix "Default Company" Issue

## Problem Identified ‚ùå

**Issue**: After login, the company selector showed "Default Company" instead of the user's actual company (e.g., "finfusion360").

**Root Cause**: 
1. `localStorage` had "Default Company" stored from a previous session
2. The auto-selection logic checked `!selectedCompany`, which failed because "Default Company" was already set
3. The useEffect wouldn't trigger to update to the user's actual company

---

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### Fix 1: Enhanced Auto-Selection Logic

**File**: `Frontend/src/components/CompanySelector.jsx`

**Before**:
```javascript
// Only ran if selectedCompany was null/undefined
if (user && user.company && !selectedCompany && companies.length > 0) {
  selectCompany(user.company)
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Runs even if selectedCompany exists, checks if it matches user's company
if (user && user.company && companies.length > 0) {
  const currentCompanyName = typeof selectedCompany === 'string' 
    ? selectedCompany 
    : selectedCompany?.name
  
  // If current company doesn't match user's company, switch it
  if (currentCompanyName !== user.company) {
    console.log('üè¢ Auto-selecting user company:', user.company, '(was:', currentCompanyName, ')')
    selectCompany(user.company)
  }
}
```

**Key Changes**:
- ‚úÖ Removed `!selectedCompany` check
- ‚úÖ Added comparison: `currentCompanyName !== user.company`
- ‚úÖ Handles both string and object company formats
- ‚úÖ Forces switch from "Default Company" to actual user company
- ‚úÖ Better console logging for debugging

---

### Fix 2: Enhanced Login Logging

**File**: `Frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.jsx`

**Added console logs**:
```javascript
// After successful login
console.log('‚úÖ User logged in successfully. Company set to:', result.company_name)

// After session restoration
console.log('‚úÖ Restored session. Company set to:', userInfo.company_name)
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Clear visibility of which company is being set
- ‚úÖ Easy debugging if issues persist
- ‚úÖ Confirmation that login sets the correct company

---

### Fix 3: Optimized Dependencies

**Before**:
```javascript
}, [user, selectedCompany, companies, selectCompany])
```

**After**:
```javascript
}, [user, companies])
```

**Why**:
- ‚úÖ Prevents infinite loops
- ‚úÖ Only re-runs when user or companies change
- ‚úÖ `selectCompany` is stable (from useCallback)
- ‚úÖ Checking `selectedCompany` inside instead of in dependencies

---

## How It Works Now

### Login Flow

```
1. User logs in with credentials
     ‚Üì
2. useAuth.login() sets:
   - user.company = "finfusion360"
   - selectedCompany = "finfusion360"
   - localStorage.selectedCompany = "finfusion360"
     ‚Üì
3. Console: "‚úÖ User logged in successfully. Company set to: finfusion360"
     ‚Üì
4. CompanySelector useEffect triggers
     ‚Üì
5. Checks: currentCompanyName !== user.company?
   - If "Default Company" !== "finfusion360" ‚Üí YES, needs update
     ‚Üì
6. Calls selectCompany("finfusion360")
     ‚Üì
7. Console: "üè¢ Auto-selecting user company: finfusion360 (was: Default Company)"
     ‚Üì
8. Company selector displays: "üè¢ finfusion360"
     ‚Üì
9. ‚úÖ USER SEES THEIR CORRECT COMPANY
```

### What Happens to "Default Company"

```
Old Behavior ‚ùå:
- "Default Company" in localStorage
- Login sets selectedCompany = "finfusion360"
- But CompanySelector doesn't update because !selectedCompany fails
- Result: Shows "Default Company"

New Behavior ‚úÖ:
- "Default Company" in localStorage (or memory)
- Login sets selectedCompany = "finfusion360"
- CompanySelector checks: "Default Company" !== "finfusion360"? YES!
- Switches to "finfusion360"
- Result: Shows "finfusion360"
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Fresh Login
```
1. Logout completely
2. Clear browser localStorage (F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí Clear)
3. Login with your credentials
4. ‚úÖ Should see your company (e.g., "finfusion360") immediately
5. ‚úÖ Console should show:
   - "‚úÖ User logged in successfully. Company set to: finfusion360"
   - "üè¢ Auto-selecting user company: finfusion360 (was: Default Company)"
```

### Test 2: Existing "Default Company" in Storage
```
1. Set localStorage.selectedCompany = "Default Company"
2. Refresh page
3. Login
4. ‚úÖ Should automatically switch from "Default Company" to your actual company
5. ‚úÖ Console shows the switch happening
```

### Test 3: Session Restoration
```
1. Login and stay logged in
2. Refresh the page
3. ‚úÖ Should restore and show your company
4. ‚úÖ Console: "‚úÖ Restored session. Company set to: finfusion360"
```

### Test 4: Manual Company Switch
```
1. Login (shows your company)
2. Click dropdown and select different company
3. ‚úÖ Should switch to selected company
4. Refresh page
5. ‚úÖ Should restore to your login company (not the manually selected one)
```

## Console Logs to Look For

### Successful Login
```
üöÄ Login attempt with: {company_name, username, password}
üöÄ Login response status: 200
üöÄ Login response data: {success: true, company_name: "finfusion360", ...}
üöÄ Setting user data after login: {username, company: "finfusion360", ...}
üöÄ Bearer token stored in localStorage: eyJ...
‚úÖ User logged in successfully. Company set to: finfusion360
üè¢ Auto-selecting user company: finfusion360 (was: Default Company)
Company selected in CompanyContext: finfusion360
Stored company in localStorage: finfusion360
```

### Session Restoration
```
üîç Initializing authentication...
üîç Valid session found, user is authenticated
‚úÖ Restored session. Company set to: finfusion360
üè¢ Auto-selecting user company: finfusion360 (was: Default Company)
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: No Companies Loaded Yet
```
- useEffect checks: companies.length > 0
- If companies not loaded, doesn't try to auto-select
- Waits for companies to load
```

### Case 2: User Has No Company
```
- useEffect checks: user && user.company
- If user.company is null/undefined, doesn't run
- No error, just doesn't auto-select
```

### Case 3: Company Already Correct
```
- useEffect checks: currentCompanyName !== user.company
- If already showing user's company, doesn't re-select
- Prevents unnecessary updates
```

### Case 4: Company is Object vs String
```
- Handles both formats:
  const currentCompanyName = typeof selectedCompany === 'string' 
    ? selectedCompany 
    : selectedCompany?.name
```

|------|---------|
| `CompanySelector.jsx` | Updated useEffect logic to force-switch from Default Company |
| `useAuth.jsx` | Added console logs for login and session restoration |

---

## Before vs After

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Login** | Shows "Default Company" | ‚úÖ Shows "finfusion360" |
| **Refresh** | Shows "Default Company" | ‚úÖ Shows "finfusion360" |
| **Console logs** | Minimal logging | ‚úÖ Clear logging with ‚úÖ and üè¢ |
| **Auto-select** | Only if !selectedCompany | ‚úÖ Always if user.company differs |
| **localStorage** | May have stale "Default Company" | ‚úÖ Overridden with user's company |

---

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Immediate feedback**: See correct company right after login
- ‚úÖ **No confusion**: Never shows "Default Company" when logged in
- ‚úÖ **Consistent experience**: Same company across page refreshes
- ‚úÖ **Visual confirmation**: Company name matches their login

### For Developers
- ‚úÖ **Clear logging**: Easy to debug with emoji indicators

- ‚úÖ **No infinite loops**: Optimized dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Edge cases handled**: Robust error handling

---

## Summary

**Problem**: "Default Company" shown instead of user's actual company

**Root Cause**: Auto-selection only checked if `selectedCompany` was empty

**Solution**: 
1. Check if `selectedCompany !== user.company`
2. Force-switch to user's company if different
3. Add logging for visibility
4. Optimize dependencies to prevent loops

**Result**: ‚úÖ Company selector always shows the logged-in user's company!

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Frontend has been restarted. Logout, login again, and you'll see your actual company (not "Default Company")!** üéâ
