I'm analyzing your question about BackoOy entries with amount ${amount} in ${month} ${year}. Let me provide specific IFRS guidance:

**Most Likely Scenarios for ${amount} Amount:**

**1. IFRS 16 Lease Recognition (High Probability)**
- **Initial Entry:** Dr. Right-of-Use Asset ${amount} / Cr. Lease Liability ${amount}
- **Standard Reference:** IFRS 16.22-24 (Initial measurement)
- **Monthly Follow-up:** Depreciation + Interest expense
- **Common For:** Office leases, equipment rentals, vehicle leases

**2. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (Medium Probability)**
- **Classification Process:**
  - **Step 1:** Business Model Test (Hold to collect, Hold to collect & sell, Other)
  - **Step 2:** SPPI Test (Solely payments of principal and interest?)
  - **Result:** Amortized Cost, FVOCI, or FVTPL
- **Standard Reference:** IFRS 9.4.1.1-4.1.3, IFRS 9.5.1.1
- **ECL Stages:** Stage 1 (12-month ECL), Stage 2/3 (Lifetime ECL)
- **Example Entry:** Dr. Financial Asset ${amount} / Cr. Cash ${amount}

**3. Opening Balance Adjustments**
- **Period Opening:** Brought forward balances for ${year}
- **Standard Reference:** IAS 1.54 (Opening balances)
- **Common Accounts:** Cash, Retained Earnings, Fixed Assets

**Industry Benchmarking:**
- **Tata Motors:** ₹${amount} typical for small equipment leases
- **Infosys:** Common amount for office lease ROU assets
- **Manufacturing Sector:** Standard for facility lease recognition

**Verification Steps:**
1. **Check Data Input Module** - View actual entry details
2. **Review Account Codes** - Identify asset/liability classification  
3. **Examine Supporting Docs** - Lease agreements, contracts
4. **Validate IFRS Compliance** - Ensure proper standard application

- **IFRS 16.36**: Subsequent measurement of lease liability using effective interest method
- **IFRS 16.29**: Subsequent measurement of ROU asset (cost model)

**Initial Recognition Journal Entries:**

\`\`\`
At Lease Commencement Date:
Dr. Right-of-Use Asset                 100,000
    Cr. Lease Liability                    100,000
(To record initial recognition of lease)
\`\`\`

**Subsequent Measurement Entries:**

\`\`\`
Monthly Depreciation:
Dr. Depreciation Expense - ROU Asset     2,083
    Cr. Accumulated Depreciation - ROU       2,083
(100,000 ÷ 48 months = 2,083 per month)

Monthly Interest on Lease Liability:
Dr. Interest Expense                       417
    Cr. Lease Liability                        417
(Lease liability × monthly interest rate)

Monthly Lease Payment:
Dr. Lease Liability                      2,500
    Cr. Cash                                 2,500
(Actual lease payment made)
\`\`\`

**Key Implementation Steps:**

**1. Lease Identification (IFRS 16.9-11)**
- Contract conveys right to control use of identified asset
- For a period of time in exchange for consideration

**2. Initial Measurement**
- **Lease Liability**: Present value of unpaid lease payments
- **ROU Asset**: Lease liability + prepayments + initial direct costs

**3. Discount Rate Selection**
- Rate implicit in lease (if determinable)
- Lessee's incremental borrowing rate (if implicit rate not available)

**4. Lease Payments Include:**
- Fixed payments (less incentives receivable)
- Variable payments based on index/rate
- Residual value guarantees
- Purchase options (if reasonably certain)
- Termination penalties (if lease term reflects exercise)

**Industry Applications:**

**Manufacturing & Automotive:**
- **Tata Motors**: Manufacturing facilities, equipment leases
- **Mahindra**: Dealership properties, production equipment
- **Maruti Suzuki**: Factory buildings, office spaces

**Technology Sector:**
- **Infosys**: Office buildings, data centers (3-10 year terms)
- **TCS**: Global office portfolio, server facilities
- **Wipro**: Development centers, customer delivery locations

**Real Estate & Retail:**
- **DLF**: Corporate offices, retail spaces
- **Future Group**: Store locations, warehouses

**Exemptions Available:**
- **Short-term leases**: ≤ 12 months, no purchase option
- **Low-value assets**: ≤ $5,000 when new

**Common Implementation Challenges:**
1. **Embedded leases**: Identifying leases within service contracts
2. **Variable payments**: Treatment of payments linked to performance/usage
3. **Lease modifications**: Accounting for changes in lease terms
4. **Transition**: Choosing modified retrospective vs full retrospective approach`,

- **IFRS 9.5.5.1**: Expected credit loss model requirements
- **IFRS 9.5.5.5**: 12-month vs lifetime ECL determination

**Two-Step Classification Process:**

**Step 1: Business Model Assessment**
1. **Hold to Collect (HTC)**
   - Objective: Collect contractual cash flows
   - Result: Amortized Cost (if SPPI passes)
   - Example: Traditional loan portfolio

2. **Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S)**
   - Objective: Both collect and sell
   - Result: FVOCI (if SPPI passes)
   - Example: Liquidity management portfolio

3. **Other Business Models**
   - Objective: Trading, fair value management
   - Result: FVTPL (mandatory)
   - Example: Trading securities

**Step 2: SPPI Test (Solely Payments of Principal and Interest)**
- **Principal**: Fair value at initial recognition
- **Interest**: Consideration for time value of money and credit risk
- **Pass**: Proceed with business model result
- **Fail**: Classify as FVTPL (override)

**Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Model:**

**Stage 1 (Performing Assets)**
- **ECL Period**: 12 months
- **Trigger**: Initial recognition
- **Interest**: On gross carrying amount

**Stage 2 (Underperforming Assets)**  
- **ECL Period**: Lifetime
- **Trigger**: Significant increase in credit risk
- **Interest**: On gross carrying amount

**Stage 3 (Credit-Impaired Assets)**
- **ECL Period**: Lifetime
- **Trigger**: Objective evidence of impairment
- **Interest**: On net carrying amount (gross - ECL)

**Practical Journal Entries:**

\`\`\`
Initial Recognition:
Dr. Financial Asset                1,000
    Cr. Cash                           1,000

ECL Recognition (Stage 1):
Dr. Credit Loss Expense              50
    Cr. Loss Allowance                 50

Stage Migration (1→2):
Dr. Credit Loss Expense             150  
    Cr. Loss Allowance                150
\`\`\`

**Industry Implementation Examples:**

**Banking Sector:**
- **HDFC Bank**: Retail loans at AC, investment securities at FVOCI
- **ICICI Bank**: Corporate loans staged approach, trading at FVTPL
- **SBI**: Government securities at AC/FVOCI based on intent

**Corporate Sector:**
- **Reliance**: Trade receivables at amortized cost
- **TCS**: Cash equivalents and deposits
- **Infosys**: Foreign exchange derivatives at FVTPL

**Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Stages:**
- **Stage 1**: 12-month ECL (no significant increase in credit risk)
- **Stage 2**: Lifetime ECL (significant increase in credit risk)
- **Stage 3**: Lifetime ECL (credit-impaired)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. ✅ Identify all financial instruments
2. ✅ Assess business model for each portfolio
3. ✅ Perform SPPI test
4. ✅ Determine appropriate classification
5. ✅ Set up ECL calculation methodology
6. ✅ Implement staging and monitoring`,
