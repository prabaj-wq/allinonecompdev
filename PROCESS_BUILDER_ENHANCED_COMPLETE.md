## All 26 Features - Detailed Logics

### 1. PROFIT & LOSS CALCULATION
**Feature ID**: `profit_loss`

**Business Logic**:
```
Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold
Operating Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses - Depreciation
EBIT = Operating Profit
PBT (Profit Before Tax) = EBIT - Interest Expense + Interest Income
PAT (Profit After Tax) = PBT - Income Tax
Net Profit = PAT Â± Other Items

Segment Profit:
  - Calculate by segment: Geography, Product, Business Line
  - Revenue by segment - Segment costs = Segment profit
  - Reconcile to consolidated profit
```

**Configuration Options**:
- Gross margin calc method: simple, weighted_average, FIFO, LIFO
- Include discontinued operations: Yes/No
- Operating profit definition (customizable line items)
- Segment definitions (geography, product, division)

- Tax rate assumption: 0-100%

**Real-Time Calculations**:
- Auto-calculate on any P&L line change
- Real-time gross margin %
- Real-time operating margin %
- Real-time net profit margin %
- Segment profit variance alerts

**API Endpoint**:
```
POST /api/process/node/add
{
  "node_type": "profit_loss",
  "configuration": {
    "gross_margin_calc_method": "weighted_average",
    "include_discontinued": true,
    "segment_profit_calc": true,
    "segment_definitions": [
      {"name": "EMEA", "type": "geography"},

    "tax_rate_assumption": 0.25
  }
}
```

### 2. NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST (NCI) HANDLING
**Feature ID**: `nci_handling`

**Business Logic**:
```
NCI Share of Profit = Subsidiary Profit Ã— (100% - Parent Ownership %)

NCI Equity Measurement:
  Method 1 (Proportionate Share):
    NCI Equity = Subsidiary Net Assets Ã— (100% - Parent %)
  
  Method 2 (Fair Value):
    NCI Equity = Subsidiary Fair Value - Parent's Share at Fair Value

NCI Adjustments:
  = Opening NCI
  + NCI Share of Current Period Profit/Loss
  + NCI Share of Other Comprehensive Income
  + NCI Share of Fair Value Adjustments
  + NCI Share of Goodwill Changes
  - Dividends to NCI
  = Closing NCI

Consolidated Equity Split:
  Parent's Equity: Total Equity - NCI Equity
  NCI Equity: As calculated above
```

**Configuration Options**:
- Measurement method: fair_value, proportionate_share
- Fair value source: market_quote, DCF, comparable_companies
- NCI share of profit: Yes/No
- NCI adjustments include: [fair_value_adj, goodwill, amort, impairment]
- Equity allocation method: at_acquisition, at_fair_value, step_by_step
- NCI balance tracking: Yes/No

**Real-Time Validation**:
- NCI % + Parent % = 100% check
- NCI equity reconciliation
- NCI profit attribution validation

**Example Scenario**:
```
Subsidiary: ABC Ltd
- Net Assets: $1,000,000
- Current Profit: $100,000
- Parent Ownership: 75%
- NCI Ownership: 25%

Calculation:
- NCI Share of Profit: $100,000 Ã— 25% = $25,000
- NCI Equity (Proportionate): $1,000,000 Ã— 25% = $250,000
- Parent's Share: $75,000 profit, $750,000 equity
```

### 3. RETAINED EARNINGS ROLLFORWARD
**Feature ID**: `retained_earnings_rollforward`

**Business Logic**:
```
Retained Earnings Rollforward:
  Opening RE
  + Current Period Net Profit/Loss
  Â± Other Comprehensive Income items (if included)
  Â± Prior Period Error Adjustments
  Â± Reclassifications
  - Dividends Declared
  Â± Other Equity Movements
  = Closing Retained Earnings

Validation:
  RE must flow through to Balance Sheet
  RE changes must reconcile to P&L + dividends Â± adjustments
  Negative RE flagged if threshold exceeded

Adjustment Categories:
  1. Prior Period Errors: Restatements
  2. Accounting Policy Changes: IAS 8 impacts
  3. Reclassifications: OCI to RE reclassifications
  4. Dividend Adjustments: Share of profit, capital adjustments
  5. Fair Value Changes: Market-to-market adjustments
```

**Configuration Options**:
- Opening RE source: prior_year_close, audited_statement, manual_entry
- Include OCI movement: Yes/No
- Include reclassifications: Yes/No
- Adjustment categories: (customizable list)
- Dividend tracking: Yes/No
- Capital adjustments: Yes/No

**Validation Rules**:
- Opening RE matches prior year closing
- Net Income properly allocated
- Dividends > 0 and â‰¤ available RE
- All adjustments documented
- Closing RE reconciles to B/S

**Example Flow**:
```
Opening RE (Prior Year Closing):        $500,000
+ Net Profit Current Year:              $150,000
+ OCI Gains (Unrealized):                $25,000
- Prior Period Error Correction:        ($10,000)
- Dividends Paid:                       ($50,000)
= Closing RE:                           $615,000
```

### 4. FOREIGN CURRENCY (FX) TRANSLATION
**Feature ID**: `fx_translation`

**Business Logic**:
```
TEMPORAL METHOD:
  Monetary Assets/Liabilities @ Closing Rate
  Non-Monetary Assets/Liabilities @ Historical Rates
  Revenue/Expenses @ Average Rate
  FX Gain/Loss = P&L Item

CURRENT RATE METHOD:
  Assets @ Closing Rate
  Liabilities @ Closing Rate
  Revenue/Expenses @ Average Rate
  FX Difference â†’ OCI (Equity) as CTA

Currency Translation Adjustment (CTA):
  CTA = Opening Equity @ Closing Rate - Opening Equity @ Historical Rate
       + (P&L @ Average Rate) - (P&L @ Average Rate)
  CTA bypasses P&L, goes to OCI/Equity

Effective Translation:
  Step 1: Translate foreign subsidiary financials to presentation currency
  Step 2: Calculate FX differences
  Step 3: Allocate CTA to parent/NCI
  Step 4: Consolidate CTA treatment

Hedge Accounting (if enabled):
  - Mark-to-market hedging instruments
  - Adjust consolidated equity
```

**Configuration Options**:
- Translation method: temporal, current_rate, functional_currency
- Spot rate date: (current or period-end)
- FX rate source: ECB, FED, manual_input, historical_average
- Translation exposure: balance_sheet, P&L, both
- CTA location: equity, P&L_item, OCI
- Hedge accounting: Yes/No
- Translation differences tracking: Yes/No

**Real-Time Features**:
- Auto-fetch rates from API if configured
- Real-time P&L impact calculation
- CTA movement tracking
- Multi-currency support

**Example Calculation**:
```
Foreign Subsidiary (EUR)
Opening Assets:       â‚¬1,000,000 @ â‚¬1 = â‚¬1 USD
Closing Assets:       â‚¬1,000,000 @ $1.10 USD = $1,100,000

FX Translation:
- Asset appreciation:  â‚¬1,000,000 Ã— ($1.10 - $1.00) = $100,000
- This goes to OCI as CTA (current rate method)
```

### 6. GOODWILL & FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS
**Feature ID**: `goodwill_fair_value_adjustments`

**Business Logic**:
```
FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION AT ACQUISITION:

Consideration Paid:                    $1,000,000
Less: Fair Value of Net Assets:
  - Current Assets FV:      $300,000
  - Fixed Assets FV:        $500,000
  - Liabilities (FV):      ($200,000)
  = Net Asset FV:           $600,000
  
Goodwill = Consideration - Net Asset FV = $400,000

AMORTIZATION:
Amortization Period:  5 years (useful life)
Annual Amortization:  $400,000 / 5 = $80,000/year
Accumulated Amortization: (increases each year)

Net Goodwill = Goodwill - Accumulated Amortization

IMPAIRMENT TESTING (Annual or more frequent):
1. Calculate recoverable amount (higher of fair value / value in use)
2. Compare to net goodwill
3. If recoverable < net goodwill â†’ Impairment loss recognized

FAIR VALUE DIFFERENCE AMORTIZATION:
Each difference (fixed assets, intangibles, etc.) has:
- Fair value adjustment amount
- Amortization period
- Annual amortization expense
- Accumulated amortization tracking

Multi-Period Adjustment:
  Year 1: FVA $100K, Amort $100K/5yr = $20K
  Year 2: Accumulated $20K, Remaining $80K
```

**Configuration Options**:
- Fair value allocation: {asset_category: amount}
- Goodwill calculation: Yes/No
- FA amortization period: 1-40 years

### 7. DEFERRED TAXES
**Feature ID**: `deferred_taxes`

**Business Logic**:
```
DEFERRED TAX CALCULATION:

Temporary Differences:
1. Depreciation: Book vs Tax differences
2. Inventory: FIFO (book) vs LIFO (tax) valuation
3. Provisions: Accrued (book) vs When Paid (tax)
4. Fair Value Adjustments: Market value (book) vs Historical cost (tax)

Deferred Tax Asset/Liability:
  DTA = Deductible Temp Diff Ã— Tax Rate
  DTL = Taxable Temp Diff Ã— Tax Rate

Applied to:
  - Fair value adjustments: Often has largest DT
  - Goodwill differences
  - IC eliminations (profit in inventory)
  - Employee benefits accruals
  - Warranty provisions

EXAMPLE:
Fair Value Increase:       $100,000
Tax Rate:                  25%
DTL Created:               $100,000 Ã— 25% = $25,000

This DTL impacts:
- B/S: Shows as Long-term Liability
- P&L: Deferred Tax Expense ($25,000)

Reversal:
  As FVA depreciates, DTL reverses
  Year 1: DTL $25K, reversal $5K (straight line)
  Deferred Tax Benefit: $5,000 (P&L item)
```

**Configuration Options**:
- Temporary difference tracking: Yes/No
- Tax rate: 0-100%
- Effective tax rate: (if different)
- DT adjustments apply to: [FX, IC, Goodwill, etc.]
- Tax loss carryforward tracking: Yes/No
- Uncertain tax positions: Yes/No

**Validation Rules**:
- Tax rate must be between 0-100%
- All temp differences identified
- DT asset limitations (50% of taxable income)
- Tax loss carryforward limits

**Business Logic**:
```
OPENING BALANCE SOURCES:

1. New Consolidation / First Year:
   - Acquire subsidiary on Jan 1
   - Opening B/S = Acquisition-date B/S
   - Fair value adjustments apply immediately

2. Acquired During Year:
   - Subsidiary opening balances at historical cost
   - Fair value adjustments effective from acquisition date

3. Prior Year Close Carried Forward:
   - Opening RE = Prior Year Closing RE
   - Opening Assets/Liabilities = Prior Yr Closing
   - Adjusted for known items

4. Prior Period Restatement:
   - Adjust opening retained earnings
   - Reclassify comparatives if needed

OPENING FAIR VALUE DIFFERENCES:
- Record at opening B/S date
- Amortize over subsequent periods
- Deferred tax impact

OPENING GOODWILL:
- Determined at acquisition
- Subject to annual impairment
- Not amortized (IFRS)

### 9. MINORITY / ASSOCIATE / JV ACCOUNTING
**Feature ID**: `minority_associate_jv_accounting`

**Business Logic**:
```
THREE INVESTMENT METHODS:

1. COST METHOD (Ownership < 20% typical):
   - Investment recorded at cost
   - Dividend income recognized when received
   - No earnings recognition
   - Simplest method
   
   Treatment:
   Investment = Purchase Price
   Income = Dividends Received Only

2. EQUITY METHOD (Associate 20-50%):
   - Initial: Investment = Cost
   - Adjust annually: 
     + Share of investee profit/loss
     + Share of investee dividends (reduce investment)
     + Amortize goodwill/FVA
     + FX translation gains/losses
   
   Formula:
   Carrying Amount = Cost + Share of Profits - Dividends - Impairment

3. FVTPL (Fair Value Through P&L):
   - Remeasure to fair value each period
   - Changes hit P&L as gain/loss
   - Used if investment held for trading

EQUITY METHOD DETAILED:
Year 1 Acquisition:
  Dr. Investment $100,000
  Cr. Cash $100,000
  Carrying Amount: $100,000

Year 1 - Associate earns $50,000:
  Dr. Investment $10,000 (20% share)
  Cr. Share of profit $10,000
  Carrying Amount: $110,000

Year 1 - Associate pays dividend $20,000:
  Dr. Cash $4,000 (20% share)
  Cr. Investment $4,000
  Carrying Amount: $106,000

EXCESS LOSSES:
- If investor's share of losses exceeds carrying amount
- Recognize excess only if:
  a) Contractual obligation, OR
  b) Investor advanced funds
- Otherwise, recognize zero loss, create liability

IMPAIRMENT:
- Test annually
- If recoverable amount < carrying amount â†’ Impairment loss
```

**Configuration Options**:
- Investment method: cost, equity_method, FVTPL
- Share of profit calc: Yes/No
- Dividend recognition: proportionate, receipt_basis
- Excess losses tracking: Yes/No
- Impairment testing: Yes/No

---

### 10. PRIOR PERIOD ERRORS & ACCOUNTING CHANGES
**Feature ID**: `prior_period_errors_changes`

**Business Logic**:
```
PRIOR PERIOD ERROR:
Definition: Omission or misstatement from prior period
Treatment: Retroactive restatement

Example Errors:
- Revenue recognized but not earned (2021 should be 2022)
- Inventory not counted (2020 year-end)
- Depreciation omitted (2019, 2020)

CORRECTION:
1. Adjust opening retained earnings
2. Restate comparative B/S
3. Restate comparative P&L
4. Disclose in notes

Impact:
Opening RE 2022 = Prior RE - Error Amount
P&L 2022 = Before + Catch-up + Current

ACCOUNTING POLICY CHANGES:
Example: FIFO to LIFO inventory

Old Policy Impact: (Historical)
New Policy Impact: (Current)
Difference: Adjustment

Treatment:
1. Retrospective: Restate all prior years
2. Prospective: Only impact current and future
3. Modified: Where prospective not possible

Most Common: Retrospective (IFRS default)

Adjustment Calculation:
  Opening RE impact
  + Specific period impacts
  = Total catch-up adjustment
```

**Configuration Options**:
- Restatement tracking: Yes/No
- Error categories: [revenue, inventory, depreciation, etc.]
- Prior years affected: (list of years)
- Adjustment method: retrospective, prospective, modified

  Other Comprehensive:   $75,000
  Non-Controlling Int.:  $225,000
  Total Closing Equity: $1,500,000

AUTOMATIC GENERATION:
- Takes opening balances from opening B/S

### 12. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) ITEMS
**Feature ID**: `oci_items`

**Business Logic**:
```
OCI COMPONENTS:

1. CURRENCY TRANSLATION DIFFERENCES:
   - FX translation of foreign subsidiaries
   - Bypass P&L, go to Equity OCI
   - May reclassify to P&L on disposal

2. REVALUATION SURPLUSES:
   - Property revaluations
   - Plant & equipment revaluations
   - Typically stay in OCI unless impairment

3. ACTUARIAL GAINS/LOSSES:

   - May reclassify on disposal

RECLASSIFICATION:
Some OCI items "recycle" to P&L when conditions met:
- Translation differences: Recycle on subsidiary disposal
- Cash flow hedges: Recycle when underlying transaction impacts P&L
- Investments: Some on disposal

Permanent Items:
- Revaluation surpluses typically remain in OCI
- Actuarial gains not recycled
```

**Configuration Options**:

### 13. WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES & EPS CALCULATION
**Feature ID**: `weighted_average_eps`

**Business Logic**:
```
BASIC EPS:
Basic EPS = Net Profit Attributable to Ordinary Shareholders / 
            Weighted Average Number of Ordinary Shares

Weighted Average Calculation:
Example:
- Jan 1: 1,000,000 shares (1 month = 1,000,000)
- Feb 1: Issue 200,000 shares (11 months = 200,000 Ã— 11/12)
- Mar 1: Buyback 100,000 shares (10 months = (100,000) Ã— 10/12)
- Dec 31: Shares balance

Weighted Average = (1,000,000 Ã— 1 + 1,200,000 Ã— 11 + 1,100,000 Ã— 10) / 12
                 = (1,000,000 + 13,200,000 + 11,000,000) / 12
                 = 1,941,667 shares

Net Income: $500,000
Basic EPS: $500,000 / 1,941,667 = $0.26 per share

DILUTED EPS:
Diluted EPS = (Net Income + Interest on Convertibles) / 
              (Weighted Avg Shares + Dilutive Effect)

Dilutive Instruments:
1. Stock Options:
   - Treasury stock method
   - Exercise proceeds = Options Ã— Strike Price
   - Shares repurchased = Proceeds / Current Stock Price
   - Dilutive effect = Options issued - Shares repurchased

   Example:
   - 100,000 options @ $10 strike
   - Current price: $15
   - Proceeds: 100,000 Ã— $10 = $1,000,000
   - Shares repurchased: $1,000,000 / $15 = 66,667
   - Dilutive effect: 100,000 - 66,667 = 33,333

2. Convertible Bonds:
   - If convertible to shares â†’ dilutive if stock price > conversion price
   - Add back: Interest Ã— (1 - Tax rate)
   - Add: Potential shares from conversion

   Example:
   - Bond: $1,000,000 @ 5% interest
   - Convertible to 100,000 shares
   - Tax rate: 25%
   - Interest add-back: $1,000,000 Ã— 5% Ã— (1 - 25%) = $37,500
   - Shares add-back: 100,000
   - Dilutive EPS effect: Include if stock > conversion price

3. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs):
   - Similar to options: Treasury stock method

ANTI-DILUTION TEST:
- Option EPS > Basic EPS? â†’ Don't include (anti-dilutive)
- Convertible EPS > Basic EPS? â†’ Don't include

WEIGHTED AVERAGE METHODS:
- Daily: Most accurate
- Monthly: Common for consolidated
- Quarterly: Less detail
```

**Configuration Options**:
- Basic EPS calc: Yes/No
- Diluted EPS calc: Yes/No
- Weighted average method: daily, monthly, quarterly
- Share buyback treatment: treasury_method, simplified
- Convertible instruments: [{type, amount, terms}]
- Options/warrants: [{quantity, strike_price, terms}]

### 14. VALUATION & IMPAIRMENT
**Feature ID**: `valuation_impairment`

**Business Logic**:
```
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST:

Annual Testing (or more frequent if indicators present):

Step 1: Calculate Fair Value of Cash Generating Unit (CGU)
   - Fair Value = Higher of:
     a) Net Selling Price
     b) Value In Use (present value of future cash flows)

Step 2: Compare Carrying Amount to Fair Value
   Goodwill Carrying Amount: $400,000
   Fair Value of CGU:      $350,000
   Impairment Loss:        $50,000

Step 3: Recognize Impairment
   Dr. Impairment Loss (P&L) $50,000
   Cr. Goodwill             $50,000
   New Goodwill: $350,000

ASSET IMPAIRMENT:
Whenever indicators present:
- Market decline (20%+ drop = indicator)
- Obsolescence
- Physical damage
- Adverse changes in regulations

2-Step Testing:
Step 1: Recoverability Test
   Carrying Amount vs. Undiscounted Cash Flows
   If CF > Carrying Amount â†’ No impairment

Step 2: Measurement
   If CF < Carrying Amount:
   Fair Value Measurement (DCF method typically)
   Fair Value = Discounted Cash Flows
   Impairment = Carrying Amount - Fair Value

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS:
Include in fair value:
- Recent market transactions
- P/E multiples (comparable companies)
- DCF with reasonable assumptions
- Expert valuations
