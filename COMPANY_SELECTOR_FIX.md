# 🏢 Company Selector - Auto-Select Active Company Fix

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem**: The company selector in the top right sidebar was not automatically showing the active user's company when they logged in.

---

## Solution Implemented

### **Auto-Select User's Company on Login**

Added a `useEffect` hook that automatically selects the user's company when:
1. User is logged in and has a company
2. No company is currently selected
3. Companies list has been loaded

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user && user.company && !selectedCompany && companies.length > 0) {
    console.log('🏢 Auto-selecting user company:', user.company)
    // Find the company object in the companies array
    const userCompany = companies.find(c => 
      (typeof c === 'string' ? c === user.company : c.name === user.company)
    )
    if (userCompany) {
      selectCompany(userCompany)
    } else {
      // If not found in companies array, use the user's company name directly
      selectCompany(user.company)
    }
  }
}, [user, selectedCompany, companies, selectCompany])
```

## File Changed

**File**: `Frontend/src/components/CompanySelector.jsx`

### Change 1: Import useAuth Hook
```diff
import { useCompany } from '../contexts/CompanyContext'
+ import { useAuth } from '../hooks/useAuth'
import CreateCompanyModal from './CreateCompanyModal'
```

### Change 2: Add Auto-Selection Logic
```diff
const CompanySelector = () => {
  const { companies, selectedCompany, selectCompany } = useCompany()
  const { user } = useAuth()
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('')
  const [showCreateModal, setShowCreateModal] = useState(false)

+  // Auto-select user's company if no company is selected
+  useEffect(() => {
+    if (user && user.company && !selectedCompany && companies.length > 0) {
+      console.log('🏢 Auto-selecting user company:', user.company)
+      const userCompany = companies.find(c => 
+        (typeof c === 'string' ? c === user.company : c.name === user.company)
+      )
+      if (userCompany) {
+        selectCompany(userCompany)
+      } else {
+        selectCompany(user.company)
+      }
+    }
+  }, [user, selectedCompany, companies, selectCompany])
```

## How It Works Now

### Login Flow

```
User logs in
     ↓
Auth system sets user.company = "finfusion360"
     ↓
CompanyContext loads companies list
     ↓
CompanySelector useEffect triggers
     ↓
Checks: user exists? ✅
Checks: user.company exists? ✅
Checks: selectedCompany is empty? ✅
Checks: companies.length > 0? ✅
     ↓
Finds "finfusion360" in companies array
     ↓
Calls selectCompany("finfusion360")
     ↓
Company selector displays "finfusion360"
     ↓
User sees their active company in top-right
```

### Manual Selection Still Works

```
User clicks company dropdown
     ↓
Sees list of all companies (user's company at top)
     ↓
User selects different company
     ↓
selectCompany() updates selectedCompany
     ↓
useEffect won't trigger again (selectedCompany is now set)
```

## Features

✅ **Auto-selects** user's company on login
✅ **Shows user's company** at the top of the dropdown list
✅ **Manual selection** still works as expected
✅ **Handles both formats**: string company names and company objects
✅ **Console logging** for debugging (shows 🏢 icon)
✅ **Prevents infinite loops** with dependency array
✅ **Fallback handling** if company not found in list

---

## Visual Result

### Before Fix ❌
```
Top-right corner:
┌──────────────┐
│ No company   │  ← Empty/not showing user's company
└──────────────┘
```

### After Fix ✅
```
Top-right corner:
┌──────────────────┐
│ 🏢 finfusion360  │  ← Automatically shows user's company
│    FIN           │
└──────────────────┘
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Login and Check Auto-Selection
```
1. Logout if logged in
2. Login with credentials
3. ✅ Top-right should immediately show your company
4. ✅ Console should show: "🏢 Auto-selecting user company: finfusion360"
```

### Test 2: Verify Manual Selection Still Works
```
1. Click on company selector dropdown
2. ✅ Should see user's company at top of list
3. Select a different company
4. ✅ Selected company should change
5. ✅ useEffect should not trigger again (no infinite loop)
```

### Test 3: Refresh Page
```
1. Refresh the page while logged in
2. ✅ Company selector should auto-select again
3. ✅ Shows user's company immediately
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
The `useEffect` depends on:
- `user` - Triggers when user logs in/out
- `selectedCompany` - Prevents re-triggering if already selected
- `companies` - Triggers when companies list loads
- `selectCompany` - Function reference (stable from useCallback)

### Why These Dependencies?
1. **user**: Need to know who is logged in and their company
2. **selectedCompany**: Prevent auto-selection if user manually chose a company
3. **companies**: Wait until companies are loaded before selecting
4. **selectCompany**: Required for ESLint exhaustive-deps rule

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **No user logged in**: Won't trigger (user check)
2. **User has no company**: Won't trigger (user.company check)
3. **Company already selected**: Won't trigger (selectedCompany check)
4. **Companies not loaded yet**: Won't trigger (companies.length check)
5. **Company not in list**: Falls back to user.company string
6. **Multiple renders**: Only triggers once due to dependencies

## Related Components

This fix interacts with:
- **CompanyContext**: Provides `companies`, `selectedCompany`, `selectCompany`
- **useAuth**: Provides `user` object with `user.company`
- **Layout**: Renders the CompanySelector in the header
- **All pages**: Use `selectedCompany` for data filtering

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add loading spinner while auto-selecting
2. Show success toast: "Switched to [company name]"
3. Remember last selected company per user in localStorage
4. Add company switching animation
5. Pre-load company data during auto-selection
